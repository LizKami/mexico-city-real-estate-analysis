The goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.

#**Problem-Statement**
The real estate market in Mexico is influenced by various factors, with property size and location often seen as key determinants of sale price. However, the relative influence of these factors remains unclear. This project aims to analyze a dataset of properties for sale from Properati.com to determine whether sale prices are more influenced by property size or location. By leveraging Python data structures and libraries such as pandas, I will clean and organize the data, visualize key relationships using scatter and box plots, and examine correlations to assess the impact of these variables on property prices. The findings from this analysis will provide insights into the primary drivers of real estate prices in Mexico, helping potential buyers and sellers make informed decisions.s
